# Dynamical-Systems-Modeling
**Goal**: Forecast Japan's population dynamics and aging trend using linear algebra.

## Tools & Technologies
- MATLAB, Excel, Leslie Matrix modeling

## Key Steps
- Constructed 101x101 matrix based on age distribution and fertility data
- Performed eigenvalue and steady-state analysis

## Findings
- Predicted 12% drop in working-age population over 10 years.
- Aging trend peaks at age 81, suggesting demographic crisis.

## Files (Check)
- `matrix_model.m`: MATLAB code
- `dashboard.xlsx`: charts and interactive visualization
